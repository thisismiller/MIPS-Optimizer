This code attempts to find pipeline stalls in a five-stage MIPS pipeline by analyzing data dependencies. For example, if you feed it the code:

    LW R2,#0(R1)
    ADD R3,R2,R1
    SUB R4,R3,R2
    BEQ R2,R4,lbl

The program will output:

    LW R2, #0(R1)
    STALL
    ADD R3, R2, R1
    SUB R4, R3, R2
    STALL
    BEQ R2, R4, lbl

Note that full forwarding is assumed.
